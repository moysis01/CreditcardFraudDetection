## Overview

Credit card fraud is a significant issue for both financial institutions and customers. This project aims to leverage machine learning algorithms to detect fraudulent transactions efficiently. The models are trained on a dataset of credit card transactions, which includes various features such as transaction amount, time, and other anonymized parameters.

## Installation

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/path/creditcardfrauddetection.git
   cd creditcardfrauddetection

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment:**
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`

2. **Install the required dependencies:**
pip install -r requirements.txt

**Usage**
To run the project, follow these steps:

1. **Prepare the dataset:**

Place your dataset (e.g., creditcard.csv) in the Dataset-Approved directory.

2. **Configure the settings:**

Modify the classifiers_config.json file to set your preferred classifiers and hyperparameters.

3. **Run the main script:**
python main.py

4. **View the results:**

The results, including logs and evaluation metrics, will be saved in the results.log file and displayed in the console.
